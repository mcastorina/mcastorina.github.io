    <p>I recently read a blog post by Dan Luu titled <a href="https://danluu.com/learn-what/">What to
Learn</a>.  As a life-long learner, the
simple title piqued my interest. I don’t tend to take recommendations
about what other people find interesting, but I’m glad I decided to at
least see what it said.</p>

<p>The advice Dan gives is not concrete or cheap, but the type of advice
that incites self reflection and personal growth. He advises to focus on
amplifying your strengths, as opposed to minimizing your weaknesses. Maybe
this is obvious to most people, but I had not thought of learning in
this way. It’s much more appealing to me to learn something completely
new than to push the boundary in an area I am more than competent in, so hearing
this made me think (more on this later).</p>

<p>Dan’s second piece of advice is to choose interests that you have a
relative aptitude for (compared to your other interests) that you also
have a good environment in which to learn.  This somewhat vague advice is
putting into practice his first piece of advice. By choosing something
you are already good at and are in a healthy learning environment, then
you will amplify your strength.  There’s nothing revolutionary here,
but I like the inclusion of the environment.  Learning doesn’t happen
in isolation. The people and resources around you will either help or
hinder you.</p>

<p>Reflecting on Dan’s advice, I think it’s quite good, though unique for
each person.  For me, I love learning about all the fascinating fields
of computing, but that doesn’t mean I need or want to become an expert in
those areas. I simply enjoy being a generalist. However, I do see the value
in gaining deep knowledge and skills by focusing on one subject.</p>

<p>As an example, in the past few months I have been very interested in
programming language development. I participated in
<a href="/posts/langjam.html">LangJam</a> completely new to the subject, and now I plan
to write <a href="https://github.com/mcastorina/burn">a more complex compiler</a>.
I wouldn’t say I’m more skilled at designing programming languages than
my other interests (though after my efforts perhaps I will), but there is a
great community of language developers in the Rust Discord that have aided
me tremendously in my journey. On the other hand, I have been interested
in security for about five years, and while I pick up skills here and
there, I haven’t made tremendous strides in that area. I have a greater
interest in security than language development, but I haven’t found
a suitable environment for me to effectively learn. As such, my focus
is currently on language development.</p>

<p>To conclude, while I like Dan’s advice for inciting self reflection,
I don’t 100% agree with it.  Of course no advice applies to everyone,
so for me I find it best to learn things I am interested in regardless
of my proclivity, as long as the environment is conducive to learning.
