    <p>I have been thinking a lot about a verse from <em>PoC||GTFO</em> titled “<a href="/assets/birdfeeder.pdf">A Parable
on the Importance of Tools; or, Build your own fucking birdfeeder.</a>”
It is a short story about a man named Noah who decided to build a boat. His friends
were confused and asked him why? Why not buy one, or rent one out for the weekend?
Noah grew tired of their questions and stated <em>“I’m building my own fucking birdfeed
because they’ve got wood at the store.”</em></p>

<p>This story appeals to me for a few reasons.  It says that you can
make anything with your own hands regardless of what people say or
think. Easier solutions might exist, but there is a personal satisfaction
for doing it yourself. You gain knowledge, experience, and a deeper
understanding to all of the details that make that thing. You might
appreciate it more. It might open your eyes to appreciating other things
that other people have made.  You can’t buy that experience. You can’t
buy that knowledge. It comes with doing the work, or at least attempting
the work.</p>

<p>At first, I thought this was why I liked it so much. I love to build
things and this story relates to that. But it is more than that.  This
passage appeals to me on a deeper level because it echoes back something
I recently learned. For a long time, as far back as childhood, I was
afraid to do things. I was afraid to be asked why I was doing things. I
wanted to do everything the right way, so I would not stand out. I read
this passage at a time in my life when I realized that my own thoughts
about what others might be thinking were holding me back. I have started
doing things that I actually want to do. I stopped worrying about what
others would think (mostly). I started caring for myself in a healthy
and loving way.  I learned to do things for myself and my wellbeing out
of the love I have for myself. It is very empowering, and this passage
echoes it back to me. Don’t let others’ thoughts, or more importantly,
what you <em>think</em> others’ thoughts are, stop you from living your best
life. Love yourself. And if people keep pestering you about why you are
doing something different from the norm, tell them you’re building your
own birdfeeder.</p>
