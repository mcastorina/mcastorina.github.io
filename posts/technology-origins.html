    <p>How did I get interested in computers and programming?</p>

<p>Well, I grew up around computers. My parents were pretty technologically
inclined, so we had computers and printers around the house. I particularly
remember playing educational video games on a Compaq and later on, other games
like Jump Start 2nd Grade, Pajama Sam, and Putt-Putt and Pep’s Balloon-O-Rama.
My older brother also spear-headed the family in the console video game
department. We had a SNES, then an N64, then a PS2 which accounted for a lot of
my childhood.</p>

<p>My older brother was also really into computers and built many of them from
parts. He also got into PC gaming, so when I expressed interest in Portal, he
advised my parents to get me the Orange Box for the holidays, which is a bundle
of games including Portal, Half Life 2, and Team Fortress 2.</p>

<p>I got a Steam account, and after beating Portal, I tried the other games in the
pack. Long story short, I got into PC gaming and started playing one
influential game: Garry’s Mod. I spent an embarrassingly number of time playing
that game. In fact, I just checked, and I have 2,701 hours on record. I’m
pretty sure I sometimes left the game running while I did other stuff, but
that’s just a poor excuse for my addiction.</p>

<p>I actually remember the exact moment that I became hooked. It was when I
discovered you can make things that move. I made a drawbridge style door (in
the darkroom of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gm_construct</code>) and my mind was blown. What solidified the
addiction was an add-on called Wiremod. This mod introduced logic gates,
buttons, and “electrically” controlled components. I spent hours and hours
learning how to build a countdown timer from logic gates to eventually build a
“defuse the bomb” minigame. I learned how to use a player entity detector to
build an automatic door. I used distance sensors to build a fort with lasers
that would shoot anyone that tried to enter. I built elevators, intricate
houses and bases, and cars, planes, and teleportation machines.</p>

<p>One specific component introduced me to software: the Expression 2 chip. This
was a chip that allowed you to define your own inputs and outputs and interact
with the server via Lua-like code. The interesting part is that you can write
code <em>in the game</em> that interacts <em>directly with the game</em>. You can apply force
to objects, get player coordinates and viewing angles, read from the in-game
chat, and so much more. I made things hover above my head and change my
player’s color (rainbow of course), an autoturret that I could control from
chat, a hologram minimap of players on the server, and even a computer with a
chat system. The possibilities were quite literally endless. Looking back, the
biggest takeaway was that I was learning how to read docs, test and debug
systems, and use complex geometry and math to manipulate physics. I learned in
a way that was extremely rewarding to me, and it never felt like school. The
reward for figuring something out was being able to use it in the game and show
it off to my friends.</p>

<p>In high school I took computer science classes where we learned Java. With my
background in Garry’s Mod, it came pretty easy to me. I also attended some
extracurricular computer science competitions. I specifically remember the first
one I went to. Not the competition so much, but my dad driving me to drop me
off at the school. It was early in the morning, and I was nervous (being an
introverted kid). My dad encouraged me and said it was good to give things a
shot. I’m glad I did because I had fun with my friends on those trips. Another
notable memory was using a vending machine at one of the schools and getting
gold dollar coins as change.</p>

<p>Since I liked computer science in high school, the natural choice was to major
in it in college. I started off my college career studying computer engineering
in which one of the required classes was digital systems and design, and I
absolutely loved that class. It taught me about transistors, digital logic
chips, and breadboarding. I was hooked and switched to major in both electrical
engineering and computer science. During my time in college I picked up a few
different languages (including C and Python) and developed an interest in
low-level programming, linux, and security.</p>

<p>I could keep going, but where does an origin end? I probably overshot it and
could’ve ended this post two paragraphs ago. Oh well! Thank you family and
Garry’s Mod :)</p>
