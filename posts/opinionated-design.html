    <p>When I first learned how to program, I was so excited about how I could
create <em>anything</em>! The possibilities were endless and I could create
in any way I choose. This is so powerful for creative coding, but
I have learned that designing systems any way I want is not the best
approach in a professional context.</p>

<p>For professional systems, opinionated designs flourish. The more
specific problem your product solves, the better. This works for two
reasons: it’s simpler and easier to understand as a customer and it’s
simpler and easier to maintain as an engineer.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on the engineer’s perspective here. As an engineer, there
are endless ways to create products, but certain ways are better
than others.  It would be hugely beneficial to be goaded in a single
direction to encourage consistent project standards. With this in mind,
any engineer should be able to join a project and quickly contribute
value. A great example of this is the Go programming language: it has
simple syntax and promotes a “one way” philosophy which encourages
writing business logic over focusing on style or insignificant
optimizations.  The distinguishing factor here is the <em>impossibility</em>
of variation. Limiting practices to “one way” prevents even the idea
of choice, which makes systems easier to build and maintain.</p>

<p>To reiterate, creative development <em>needs</em> endless possibilities, but
professional development benefits from opinionated tooling. I believe
we will see a growth in opinionated libraries and tools as the software
engineering field matures, and even more opinionated languages like Go
and Rust.</p>
