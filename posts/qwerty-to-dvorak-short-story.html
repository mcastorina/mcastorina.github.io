    <p>It wasn’t easy, and it wasn’t hard. It happened before I knew it
was happening. I was just trying to learn Dvorak for fun, but I
went too far into the woods and I lost direction. All of a sudden
I was in a limbo. I wasn’t proficient in Dvorak, and I wasn’t
proficient in QWERTY anymore. Typing became a challenge and it
forced me to really think before writing text down. In this limbo,
I was faced with a question: do I keep walking through the woods,
hoping for greener pastures on the other side? Or do I turn around
and try to find my way back?</p>

<p>I chose to keep going. It wasn’t easy, but it wasn’t hard. Mostly
frustrating at the slow pace. But a week passed and I was faltering
less. Another week passed and my WPM grew to 50. Slowly, I retrained
my fingers to know the Dvorak landscape, and to glide across it
with ease.</p>

<p>A month later and I am still coming out of the woods. I can see the
greener pastures, and there is definitely no turning back now.
Reflecting on this journey has taught me a very important lesson
about relearning: It takes time, patience, and persistence. It won’t
be easy, but it won’t be hard.</p>
