# Veganism
Veganism is the practice of abstaining from using animal products,
especially in food, but it applies to all parts of life.

## Benefits
Eating vegan benefits the animals, environment, and your health and
well being. It is a win-win situation where everyone is better off.
There are no real disadvantages to eating a plant based diet. The
only one I can see is the social pressure. Unsupportive friends
or family members can strongly influence your decisions, and they
probably are not your real friends if they negatively influence you.

### Animals
The most immediate benefit of eating a plant based diet is you will
save innocent animals from being slaughtered. As a consumer, every
dollar spent is a vote for what is in demand. The less people
buy meat, the less demand there will be.

### Environment
With a lower population of animals to feed, fewer resources will be
required. The current meat and dairy industry is unsustainable. It takes
an enormous amount of water, food (plants), land, and energy to make meat.
The meat industry is also the number one contributor to green house gas
emissions and habitat destruction.

### Personal Health
Eating a plant based diet is better in every possible way for your
personal health. Among the obvious medicinal benefits (like lower
cholesterol), eating vegan gives you a lot of energy. You have more
strength and persistence. You also recover more rapidly from injury.
On a vegan diet, you are giving your body the nutrients it needs to
thrive. Aside from the physical benefits, I believe living a vegan
lifestyle is a more mindful lifestyle. There is intention behind
your choices that connects you to the world in a loving way.

## Misconceptions

**Vitamin B-12**

Naturally occurring sources of B-12 come from bacteria, and humans
historically got it from eating small amounts of dirt on their food
or from drinking river water. Now, with antibiotics and chlorinated
water, it is recommended everyone should take a B-12 supplement.

**Protein**

Protein is an amino acid that is produced by plants. You get more
protein eating plants than meat.

**Soy has a lot of estrogen**

Soy has *phytoestrogen* -- estrogen-like compounds structured
similarly to estrogen but is not estrogen.

**Vegans are weak**

There are countless vegan athletes setting world records. There are
high achieving vegan athletes in football, martial arts, body
building, soccer, track and field, marathons, arm wrestling, and
more.
