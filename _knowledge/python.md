# Python
Python is a general purpose programming language that is very easy
to use. I consider it a "high level" language because it has object
oriented structures, garbage collection, dynamic typing, and it is
interpreted. Python aims for readable code by using indentation for
code blocks as well.

## Hello World
```python
print('Hello, World!')
```

## Python Package Index
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/) is a repository for python packages. It
allows for anyone to publish or download published packages very
easily.
