The Dvorak keyboard layout is designed to be a faster, more ergonomic
alternative to the QWERTY layout.

Personally, I have switched my phone layout to use Dvorak while
keeping my computer's layout to QWERTY. Typing on my phone is now
a lot easier and faster, and it has definitely been a great way to
learn the Dvorak layout. Surprisingly, this has not affected my
normal keyboard usage at all.

UPDATE: I now exclusively use Dvorak. Who saw that coming?
