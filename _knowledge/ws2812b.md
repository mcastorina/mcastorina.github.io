# WS2812B
WS2812B is a control circuit and serial protocol used for controlling LEDs
(usually in a strip). It requires only a single wire for data transfer
in addition to power (5V) and ground. Each LED is addressable using this
protocol as well.

## Protocol
Because it uses a single wire, communication is done serially one bit
at a time. 24 bits of data is sent for each LED (GRB) in the circuit
followed by a reset code. Each circuit consumes the first 24 bits it
receives and passes the rest of the data along the line.

This is a timed protocol: each bit takes 1.25 μs to transfer. For both
0 and 1, the line is driven high, then low for differing amounts of time
to distinguish the two. Additionally, there is a RESET code where the line
is low for a certain amount of time.

| Symbol | Time    | Tolerance |
| ------ | ------- | --------- |
| T0H    | 0.4 μs  | ± 150 ns  |
| T0L    | 0.85 μs | ± 150 ns  |
| T1H    | 0.8 μs  | ± 150 ns  |
| T1L    | 0.45 μs | ± 150 ns  |
| Treset | > 50 μs |           |

Additionally, the highest bit is sent first (B7, B6, B5, B4, B3, B2, B1, B0).
