# Electrical Components
These components are a few of the many building blocks of analog circuits.

| Component | Description | Schematic Symbol |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Resistor  | Limits current | |
| Capacitor | Stores electric charge | |
| Inductor  | Stores energy in a magnetic field | |
| Diode     | Allows current flow in one direction | |
| Transistor| Amplifies or switches electric signals | |

## Relationships
All of these components have mathematical relationships with voltage
and current. The most useful one being Ohm's Law.

{% raw %}
$$
V = I\cdot R
$$

where V is voltage, I is current, and R is resistance.

{% endraw %}
