I am a life long learner. I love to learn new things specifically
about building and designing things. I think this roots from my
childhood: playing with [Legos](https://www.lego.com/en-us) and
building high tech houses in [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/)
allowed my creativity to grow.

## Style
I learn best by doing. Having the experience, doing the lab, and
playing with the subject solidifies the knowledge for me. Prior to
gaining experience, watching experts or lectures and taking handwritten
notes is the best way for me to learn concepts.

## Goals
Below is a (non-exhaustive) list of subjects I currently wish to
learn about.

| Subject | Link |
| ------- | ---- |
| Wood Working | |
| Metal Working | |
| Mechanical Movements | |
| Data Science | |
| Ruby on Rails | |
| Penetration Testing | |
| Architecture | |
| Interior Design | |
| Lighting Design | |
