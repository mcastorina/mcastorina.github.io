# Notebooks
For some reason, I really enjoy owning notebooks and writing in
them. My favorite I have found is the [Leuchtterm 1917
Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm1917-Medium-Dotted-Hardcover-Notebook/dp/B002TSIMW4).
It has numbered and dotted pages, a pocket in the back, stickers
for archiving, and a clean style. I wish I had found it in high
school or college!
