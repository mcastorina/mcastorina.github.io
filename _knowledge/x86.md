# x86 Assembly
x86 (32-bit) and x86-64 (64-bit) assembly is syntactic sugar for
machine code that gets executed by a CPU. The two flavors of assembly
are intel and att, however intel is much more digestible.

## Registers
There are 16 registers available, 3 of which are special purpose.

* **rbp:** base pointer (points to the bottom of the stack frame)
* **rsp:** stack pointer (points to the top of the stack)
* **rip:** instruction pointer (points to the instruction to be executed)

### Segment Registers
Early CPU implementations had special registers for [memory
segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_segmentation),
essentially allowing more addresses than could fit in a single register.
The x86-64 architecture does not use segmentation in 64-bit mode, though
it is still supported for backwards compatibility. In 64-bit mode, all
segment registers are forced to 0 except for FS and GS which allows the
OS to use them for special purposes.

| Register (2 Bytes) | Description |
|:------------------:|:----------- |
| `cs`               | Code segment |
| `ds`               | Data segment |
| `ss`               | Stack segment |
| `es`               | Extra segment |
| `fs`               | Extra segment |
| `gs`               | Extra segment |

## Calling Conventions
When a function is called in assembly, generally what happens:

1. Save caller-saved registers (if any)
1. Push the arguments onto the stack (if any)
1. Push the **return address** onto the stack
1. Push the **base pointer** onto the stack
1. Set the **stack pointer** to the **base pointer**
1. Subtract the **stack pointer** to make room for local variables
1. The return value will be stored in **rax** (64-bit) or **eax** (32-bit)

### 64-bit Conventions
* Function arguments are first put into registers `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`,
  `rcx`, `r8`, `r9` respectively, then pushed onto the stack *in reverse
  order* if there are more
* **caller-saved registers:** `r10`, `r11`, and any registers that
  parameters are put into
* **callee-saved registers:** `rbx`, `rbp`, `r12`, `r13`, `r14`, and `r15`

[Reference](https://aaronbloomfield.github.io/pdr/book/x86-64bit-ccc-chapter.pdf)

### 32-bit Conventions
* All function arguments are pushed onto the stack *in reverse order*
* **caller-saved registers:** `eax`, `ecx`, and `edx`
* **callee-saved registers:** `ebx`, `edi`, and `esi`

## System Calls
System calls are a way for programs to request the kernel to do something
on the user's behalf, such as open, read, write files or fork and exec
processes.

In **64-bit**, the `syscall` instruction is used with the syscall number in
`rax`. Arguments are put into registers `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`,
`r8`, and `r9`. `rcx` and `r11` will be clobbered by the syscall and
the return value will be in `rax`.

In **32-bit**, the `int 0x80` instruction is used with the syscall number
in `eax`. Arguments are put into registers `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`, `rsi`,
`rdi`, and `rbp`. The return value will be in `eax`.

## Flags
Flags are stored in a special 32-bit `EFLAGS` register.

| Bit | Name | Description |
|:---:|:----:|:------------|
| 0   | `CF` | **Carry Flag**; set if the last arithmetic operation carried or borrowed a bit beyond the size of the register |
| 2   | `PF` | **Parity Flag**; set if the number of set bits in the least significant byte is a multiple of 2 |
| 4   | `AF` | **Adjust Flag**; carry of binary coded decimal numbers arithmetic operations |
| 6   | `ZF` | **Zero Flag**; set if the result of an operation is 0 |
| 7   | `SF` | **Sign Flag**; set if the result of an operation is negative |
| 8   | `TF` | **Trap Flag**; set if step by step debugging |
| 9   | `IF` | **Interruption Flag**; set if interrupts are enabled |
| 10  | `DF` | **Direction Flag**; stream direction. If set, string operations will decrement their pointer rather than incrementing it, reading memory backwards |
| 11  | `OF` | **Overflow Flag**; set if signed arithmetic operations result in a value too large for the register to contain |
| 12/13 | `IOPL` | **I/O Privilege Level field (2 bits)**; I/O Privilege Level of the current process |
| 14  | `NT` | **Nested Task flag**; controls chaining of interrupts. Set if the current process is linked to the next process |
| 16  | `RF` | **Resume Flag**; response to debug exceptions |
| 17  | `VM` | **Virtual-8086 Mode**; set if in 8086 compatibility mode |
| 18  | `AC` | **Alignment Check**; set if alignment checking of memory references is done |
| 19  | `VIF`| **Virtual Interrupt Flag**; virtual image of IF |
| 20  | `VIP`| **Virtual Interrupt Pending flag**; set if an interrupt is pending |
| 21  | `ID` | **Identification flag**; support for CPUID instruction if can be set |


## Instructions
Instructions are variable length and encoded in bytes (not included here). This is not an exhaustive list.

| Instruction | Description |
|:----------- |:----------- |
| `mov dst, src` | Move data from register `src` to register `dst` |
| `mov dst, [src]` | Move data from memory at register `src` to register `dst` |
| `mov [dst], src` | Move data from register `src` to memory at register `dst` |
| `lea dst, [src]` | **load effective address**; move the address of `src` to `dst` |
| `add dst, src` | Add `dst` and `src` and store the result in `dst` |
| `sub dst, src` | Subtract `dst` and `src` and store the result in `dst` |
| `xor dst, src` | Xor `dst` and `src` and store the result in `dst` |
| `push src` | Grow the stack (subtract bytes) and copy the value in `src` to the top of the stack |
| `pop dst` | Copy the value at the top of the stack into `dst` and shrink the stack (add bytes) |
| `jmp addr` | Set the instruction pointer (`rip`) to `addr` |
| `call addr` | Push `rip` onto the stack, then jump to `addr` |
| `leave` | Resets the stack frame; set the stack pointer to the base pointer, then pop the base pointer from stack |
| `ret` | Pop `rip` from the stack |
| `jnz addr` | Jump to `addr` if the zero flag is not set |
| `jz addr` | Jump to `addr` if the zero flag is set |
