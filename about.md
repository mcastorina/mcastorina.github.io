I am an engineer who loves to build things. I graduated from the
University of Texas at Austin with two Bachelorâ€™s degrees in Computer
Science and Electrical Engineering. My current interests include
data science and visualization, network security, lock picking, and
microcontrollers. As my degrees portray, I love working with both
the hardware and software side of things.

Aside from engineering, I enjoy vegan cooking, playing soccer, rock
climbing, playing with my dogs, and learning. I love puzzles and
am always up for a challenge.
