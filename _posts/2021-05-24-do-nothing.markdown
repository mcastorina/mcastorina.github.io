In January of this year, I left my corporate software engineering position
to do nothing, and it was one of the best decisions I have made.

Before I get into the "why", I'd like to point out that I am in a
fortunate place to be able to leave my main source of income without
lining up my next source. I was able to do this because I am young with
few responsibilities, some savings, and on good terms with my parents,
who happily welcomed me back home.

So why was leaving a job so pivotal for me? As you may have guessed
from the title of this post, it allowed me to grow as a person. As
with most Americans, I had been busy with *something* since I started
Kindergarten.  First it was school, then college, then work; all without
a break or taking time just to figure out who I am and where I want to
go in life. When I left my job, all of my thoughts, ideas, and fears
became so much more apparent. I could witness my life in a way that I
was mentally not able to in the past, and having this perspective is
the first step in growing.

As an example, I improved my relationship with money when I cut off my
income source.  All my life I would save money because I had a fear
of not having enough. When I cut off the source of money, I forced myself
into an experience where money could not ease my fears. I learned to
enjoy life for what it is. I let go of those fears, and learned that
money is not important for living the way I want to live.

Having this level of self awareness is a skill that I could only learn
by having nothing else on my plate, but it is absolutely a skill that
I will keep with me for the rest of my life. As humans, we are always
growing and learning; always doing our best. Knowing how you think is
one of the best ways to improve and grow in life, and I am so grateful
to have received this view into myself.
