I am a lifelong learner, and I love to take notes. Any type of
notes. There is something about recording knowledge that just gets
me excited! Note taking is a common practice among high school
students, using pen and paper. When I went to college, I began
taking digital notes. Being somewhat of a perfectionist, I would
write them using LaTeX. It would take twice as long, but I was
convinced the end result was always better. As I transitioned into
adulthood where formal classes are rare, I pretty much stopped
taking notes altogether. Job related tasks did not warrant a cause
for notes. It was a different type of learning at work. I would use
sticky pads here and there, but I was not convinced I should be
taking notes daily. In addition, my strive for perfection dissuaded
me from even beginning. Daily tasks and job responsibilities are
messy, often ill defined. How could I even begin to capture that
in a file?

As I mentioned, I am a lifelong learner, and through a video course
I was taking, I discovered [Zim Desktop Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/).
I was completely blown away by features offered by Zim; features I
did not even know existed. All of a sudden I had this fantastic
tool that allowed me to write down all of my thoughts, ideas, and
plans in an easy and organized fashion. Zim gave me the space that
I did not know I needed. I feel free to write down any idea that I
come up with and to dive into as much detail as I please.

Zim's wide array of features make it a great tool for work, course
notes, and my personal goals. I use the daily journal feature to
transcribe all work related thoughts and actions, so I can easily
look back at any day and know exactly what I did. I have made a
habit to record the impacts of my work as well, so I can readily
review my accomplishments. For course notes, Zim's hierarchical
structure is by far the best way to keep them clean. I can easily
breakup each chapter into sub-chapters and so on, including examples
without cluttering the theory. Additionally, Zim has an equation
editor and can export pages to LaTeX! I can have my cake and eat
it too.

With all that being said, the largest enhancement to my life has
been my ability to write down and track my long term goals. Zim
empowers me by making it easy to reference, expand upon, and review
a single page of my goals. I no longer forget things that I want
to work on, and my entire track record is there for me to view.
Having a single place to collect my thoughts and ideas has kept me
accountable in achieving my goals.

Overall, I am grateful to have found this fantastic tool. It has
helped me organize my thoughts, goals, and life. I happily take
notes every day, and I even wrote this post in Zim!
