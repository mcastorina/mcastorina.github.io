..everything looks like a nail.

This is one of my favorite quotes because
it is applicable to so many domains.  As
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument)
states, it depicts a cognitive bias towards using a familiar tool in
any situation. Humans are very creative, and if all we know is hammer,
we will definitely find a way to use it on a screw.

But the beauty in this quote is the reminder that there probably is a
better tool for the problem you are trying to solve. Relying on only what
you already know is counter-productive when the tools don't fit the
task, so it's a good idea to do a quick search first. That being said,
don't adopt the latest technology du jour just because it is popular
today. Assess the time / complexity trade-offs of learning a new tool
versus using what you have.

People are very inventive, and chances are someone has built a better
tool for the issue you are facing!
