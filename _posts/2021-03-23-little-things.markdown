All big things started small. It started as a thought, a seed, and with
consistent watering grew into a big tree.

Doing little things consistently will grow into big things. It's easy too!
The hardest part is regularly showing up.

I like to imagine my ideas as trees. Each one is unique and they always
start as a seed.  By giving an idea attention, I'm watering it. If I
don't water it, it will never grow! Even worse, if I'm not consistently
watering my tree, it will die.

I have struggled with this quite a lot. I get very excited about new
ideas.  I focus on it for a week or two, then move all my focus onto
something else.  This includes writing posts, which I haven't done in
two months. It's not necessarily bad to not post something when you have
nothing to write about, but I would like to dedicate some time to finding
interesting subjects. The world is big and has so many interesting things!

I'm hoping that by making my ideas trees, I will water them more
consistently.
