This past weekend I (virtually) attended DEFCON 28. It was my first
DEFCON experience, and I have to say it was really great! There
were so many talks that interested me with very friendly speakers
and community. The IoT Village in specific really spoke to me, and
inspired me to start learning hardware hacking more in depth.

I think this has been a long time coming. Working as a software
engineer is great, but I have always missed working on hardware.
Some of my proudest projects are on microcontrollers, so pursuing
this definitely made sense for me.

## Practice
To get back into a MCU mindset, I decided to work on
[microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com/), an online CTF
targeting virtualized MSP430 microcontrollers.

Microcorruption is fantastic, especially for beginners to get an
understanding of reverse engineering microcontrollers. It uses a
simplified debugger, and does all the hard work of setting up
the system for you to analyze. It even has a tutorial that walks
you through solving the first challenge, step by step.

## Next Steps
Once I complete microcorruption, I plan to create my own hardware lab.
I have some old MSP430's from school and various other microcontrollers
laying about. That should work well and make for a more interesting post :)

## Tips for Starting Out
If you somehow found this post and are wanting to start hacking on
hardware too, I suggest learning some fundamentals:

* how a CPU actually works (computer architecture)
* assembly and instruction set architectures
* [C language](/knowledge/c.html)

Or you can dive into [microcorruption](https://microcorruption.com/),
but learning the above will result in less headaches. Good luck,
and feel free to contact me!
