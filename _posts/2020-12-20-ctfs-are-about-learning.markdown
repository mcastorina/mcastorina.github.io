Capture the Flag (CTF) events are common competitions in the security
field. Many CTFs use Jeopardy style challenges where you can pick and
choose which ones you want to solve with varying point rewards. It is
a ton of fun, but when I first started, I thought the goal of CTFs
were to win. You get the most points, you win, and you get a prize! Of
course that's the point, right? Well, no, not really.

I learned from [Live Overflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lus7aNf2xDg)
that you shouldn't care about the points or about winning. They are
about challenging yourself to solve problems that are just a little bit
out of reach of your current knowledge. You can struggle with it and try
to figure it out. But if you don't, you can read someone else's writeup
for it and actually learn another way to approach the problem. You learn
where you went wrong or what you did right.

The important piece of advice is to look for challenges that are just
out of your range. If you stick to all of the easy problems, you don't
really learn anything new. It's similar to parkour where you challenge
yourself to achieve a certain movement. You look for something you haven't
done before, or something that is slightly out of your comfort zone. It
grows you as an athlete. As such, doing challenging CTF problems grows
you as a security professional.

This might have been obvious to some people, but it really opened my eyes
to how easily I fell into avoiding CTFs because I found it stressful
to get as many points as possible in the allotted time.  Like with
everything in life, you get what you put in. For me, CTFs are now about
learning, not getting points. All it took for me to start growing more
was changing how I see it.

P.S. If you want to get started with CTFs too, I recommend Carnegie
Mellon's [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/) because it is available year
round.
