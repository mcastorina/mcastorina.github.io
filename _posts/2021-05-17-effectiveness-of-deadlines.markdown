Eight weeks ago [I started tracking what I worked on each
day](/posts/little-things.html).  I laid out a star board for all of my
interests, and I would fill in a square if I gave it attention that day. I
call this "watering my ideas," and it has hugely helped me remember and
allocate time for the projects that I wasn't giving enough attention to,
including this blog.

Eight weeks ago I also gave myself a goal to publish a post every
Tuesday. I have achieved that goal every week without fail, and I am so
proud to be consistently adding to my website. The other interests on my
board, however, have not seen similar progression.

The reason I have seen good results for my writing is because I gave
myself a deadline to reach a goal every week. Having a deadline motivates
me to make substantial progress each week, and I can easily review my
achievements to see the progress of all my little steps.  This provides
further motivation to keep the streak going, and eventually forms a habit.

I would call these "micro-deadlines" and they are only effective when
managed for yourself. In other words, if you are setting deadlines
for others, this approach is not a good idea. The power of these
self-motivated deadlines is the sense of ownership and achievement
gained. Like I said, I feel so proud to have written a post every week
for the past eight weeks, and I would not feel that way if my manager
*told* me to do it.

"Macro-deadlines", on the other hand, can also play an important role in
achieving your goals. Last year I wanted to build a lamp for my desk,
so I started planning out all the details. I decided to give myself
a deadline of January 1st to complete it, and by January 1st I still
wasn't done. But I was really close! Within two weeks I completed the
project and now I happily use my lamp every day.

I believe if I had not given myself that "macro-deadline", I would
still be working on that project today. Having a target completion date
motivated me to take significant steps and tackle unknowns that I
feared. It is very easy for me to push off decisions to "when I have more
information" or "when I have X, Y, and Z done", but knowing a deadline
is approaching is enough for me to make the decision now.

To summarize, I have learned that even though I aim to take little
steps in my interests each day, setting personal deadlines is very good
motivation for me to reach my goals. Even if I don't meet the deadline,
I still make great progress toward completing a project, and it helps
me overcome and face decisions I would otherwise avoid.
