    <p>Rust is a systems programming language designed for memory safety

through an ownership system. The rust compiler keeps track of which

<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>
<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fn main<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    println!<span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>
<p>Rust has a powerful trait system that describes functionality for
a set of structs (similar to Go’s interface system). There are some
standard traits that are very helpful, like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">From</code> trait for
error handling.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">impl</span> <span class="nb">From</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">Error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">fn</span> <span class="nf">from</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">err</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">T</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">-&gt;</span> <span class="n">Error</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// ...</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>By implementing this trait, you can use a common error type and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>
operator will automatically convert between types when returning.</p>

<h2 id="sum-types">Sum Types</h2>
<p>I first learned about sum types from Rust’s enums. A sum type is structure
that may be one of many different variants. Each variant can have any number
of attributes associated with it as well.</p>

<p>The most basic sum type is Rust’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type. It may be either
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Some(T)</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code>. I believe this is a great improvement to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>
checking that forces you to handle the error case. Most compilers,
including Rust, will enforce that you check all variants of a sum type.</p>
