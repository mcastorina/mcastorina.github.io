title: 2023 Reflections and 2024 Goals
---

Okay, I know I'm *finally* finishing this post in NOVEMBER when 2024 is almost
over, and it was mainly postponed because I lacked 2024 goals. So I've
reflected on why and shared my thoughts below.

But first, 2023 reflections! I made a *huge* life change that made it a great
year for me.

It took me awhile to get everything ready and find a place to rent, but I
finally did it! I chose Seattle for a few reasons. The nature in the Pacific
Northwest really calls to me, and I want to go on hikes and enjoy it. I also
have a few friends in Seattle, so it was an easier transition socially.
Finally, Seattle has a pretty good tech scene, so I'll have more opportunities
to make friends. So far, I really love it here and am grateful I made the jump!

My friend and I took a great road trip to Sequoia and Yosemite. It was such an
amazing trip, and while I would enjoy the beauty of these parks alone, I had so
much more fun sharing the memories with my friend.

I also went on a hike in the Seattle area! Similarly, the views were
beautiful, but the friends really made it a great experience.

{{< details "**Joined a parkour community**" >}}

I started attending parkour classes in Seattle and found the community to be
really lovely and welcoming. I'm happy to say I've made friends there and I
regularly train twice a week.

So now for 2024 goals, or, lack of goals. At first, I thought I was
procrastinating on this blog post because of laziness or low blogging
motivation (I mean, it *has* been over a year since my last post) or some other
excuse. But I realized it's an indication that I couldn't think of any goals
for 2024. And that's okay! I made a huge change in my life near the end of 2023
and I just felt like I needed time to settle. I didn't *need* to have goals for 2024.
I was at a time in my life where I just wanted to experience and enjoy it. And I did.
